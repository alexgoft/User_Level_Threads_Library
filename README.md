# User Level Threads Library

This is a functional static library, for user-level threads creation and management.
In order to manage the threads, a Round-Robin (RR) scheduling algorithm was implemented.
In addition, an error handling mechanism was implemented as well (for casses, in example, when a function in the threads library fails).
